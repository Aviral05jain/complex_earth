a branch of algorithms that make predictions based on the previous data by making training models. we can say that it is a subset of ai.
it invloves use of algorithms and statistical models to enable
computer systems to improve performance on a specific task over time by learning from the data

ml is used in market predicting
stock prediction

AI
field of mathematics or biology that deals with study of ways to buid intelligent programs and machines taht can creatively solve problems,that has always been considered a human perogative.

MML

DL



types of machine learning:
supervised learing-uses labeled dataset 
unsupervised learning- there is no label in the dataset
semi supervised learning
renforcement learning



supervised learning 
based on classification:
random forest
logistic decision tree


unsupervised learning:
based on clustering:
based on 





important terms of ml:
performance
explainability
complexity
dataset size
dimensionality
training time and cost
inference time



what is preprocessing data?
why preprocessing data?


data:
incomplete-lacking vvlaues,certian attributes of interest etc.
noisy-containing errors or outliers

data cleaning(fill in missing values smooth out noise
data integration 
data transformation 
data reduction
